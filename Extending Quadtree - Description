Developed a Quadtree application
for University of Leeds Programming Project module.

This program:
- generates and destroys a quadtree, so no memory is lost
  hence avoiding memory leaks;
- grows the tree by one level with or without a limit set
- can plot mathematical equations with the help of gnuplot.

Code developed in C
